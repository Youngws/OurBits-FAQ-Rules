[*]The allowed formats are .gif, .jpg and .png. 
[*]Be considerate. Resize your images to a width of 150 px and a size of no more than 150 KB. (Browsers will rescale them anyway: smaller images will be expanded and will not look good; larger images will just waste bandwidth and CPU cycles.)
[*]Do not use potentially offensive material involving porn, religious material, animal / human cruelty or ideologically charged images. Staff members have wide discretion on what is acceptable. If in doubt PM one.
