[b]Dupe rules: both quality and speed make sense! [color=red][i]Come into force on 2018/11/17.[/i][/color][/b]
        To ensure the integrity of the OurBits system, the internal groups have priority in the DUPE rules.
     [*]If internal groups haven't released, the DUPE rules are executed as follows:
                 [*]Episode: After a season is completed, episode(s) is no longer allowed to upload.
                 [*]WEB-DL: Only raw video, audio and subtitle track(s) can be contained. Only one edition is reseved in the same quality.
                 [*]REMUX: REMUX files that do not contain any Chinese or English subtitles are not allowed. Only one edition is reseved in the same quality.
                 [*]Capture: Only one edition is reseved in the same quality.
                 [*]DVD: DVD5 and DVD9 only.
                 [*]Encode: Only one torrent of Scene release and P2P release is reseved respectively for each edition. 
Considering our members' distribution, we will reseve the edition with a matched Chinese subtitle/audio. Encodes in different editions don't DUPE each other. Only one torrent is reseved in the same quality for each edition. 
Different editions mean extended, theater, CC , 4K remaster edition, etc.
                 [*]Untouched BDs in different editions don't DUPE each other. Only one torrent is reseved for each edition.
                 [*]CUSTOM BD: Only one edition is reserved, and it must contain Chinese subtitle or audio track(s).
     [*]If internal groups have released, the duplication ends directly, please do not upload any torrents in the same quality. 
     [*]If your file(s) is indeed an exception, don't hesitate to PM staff.

[b]PACKING RULES [color=red](ANY PACK VIOLATING THE RULES WILL BE DELETE DIRECTLY)[/color][/b]
        ONLY the following contents are allowed to be packed in principle:
        [*]HD movie collections sold as box set (e.g. [i]The Ultimate Matrix Collection Blu-ray Box[/i]).
        [*]Complete season of TV Series/TV shows/animes, can only upload in a single season.
        [*]Documentaries on the same specific subject matter.
        [*]Animes, character songs, dramas, etc. that are released in separate volumes.
        [*]Packed video contents must be from media of the same type (e.g. Blu-ray discs), in the same resolution standard (e.g. 720p), and encoded in the same video and audio codec (e.g. x264 and flac). However, trailer are exceptions. Moreover, a collection should be released from the same group. Corresponding individual torrents can be removed upon packing, depending on actual situation.
        If you are not clear of anything about packing, please [url=contactstaff.php]consult the staff[/url]. Staff reserve all the rights to interpret and deal with packing-related issues.
