[*]The most important rule: Use your better judgment!
[*]Don't be afraid to say [b]NO[/b]!
[*]Don't defy another staff member in public, instead send a PM or through IM.
[*]Don't act prematurely, let the users make their mistakes and THEN correct them.
[*]Try correcting any "off topics" rather then closing a thread.
[*]Move topics rather than locking them.
[*]Be tolerant when moderating the chat section (give them some slack).
[*]If you lock a topic, give a brief explanation as to why you're locking it.
[*]Before you disable a user account, send him/her a PM and if they reply, put them on a 2 week trial.
[*]Convince people by reasoning rather than authority.
